Train generic classifier
    Pan sharpen images
    Consider training classifiers for each ecological zone
Improve development classifier
    Use cuda-convnet2
    Use dropout
    Consider optimizing get_counts by searching maximums locally
    Consider adding random caching to get_next_batch
    Consider making coarse classifier to optimize speed
    Experiment with autoencoders to pretrain neural network
